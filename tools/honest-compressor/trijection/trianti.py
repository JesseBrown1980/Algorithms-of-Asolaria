trianti.py — THE SYMMETRY GROUP OF THE 27-CUBE (trinary inversion & anti-inversion).
Operator: Jesse Daniel Brown. Sealed 2026-07-21. Companion to trijection.py / njection.py.

27 = 3^3, so one base-27 digit = 3 balanced trits: cells (t1,t2,t3) in {-1,0,+1}^3.

Two inversions, differing in ORDER:
  * NEGATION  N : t -> -t          (reflect through center)  -- ORDER 2, self-inverse
                  (the binary-style inversion: its own anti-inversion, N.N = id)
  * ROTATION  R : (a,b,c)->(c,a,b) (3-cycle of the axes)     -- ORDER 3
                  ANTI-inversion R^-1 = R^2 (counter-rotation), and R != R^-1.
                  R^0, R^1, R^2 = 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 -> close to unity (the "pie" = 1).
                  This is "trianti pie": R^2 completes the pie back to whole.

THE FIXED POINT: the center (0,0,0) is fixed by N, R, and R^2 alike. The free center
is the fixed point of the ENTIRE symmetry group -- which is exactly why it costs nothing:
it does not move under inversion OR anti-inversion.

HONEST LINE: N, R, R^2 are lossless PERMUTATIONS of the 27 cells (bijective symmetries,
rate 1.0 -- re-relation, not sub-entropy compression). They give the trijection its
STRUCTURE (order-3 with a distinct anti), not a reduction below entropy. The pie closing
to 1 is the GROUP closing, not information vanishing. But order-3-with-a-distinct-anti is
precisely what a 2-machine bijection cannot provide.
