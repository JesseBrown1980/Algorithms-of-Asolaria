"""
rime_bpc.py — the HONEST bpc of the rime system, tested rime-directionally with the
rime Bobby Fischer. Operator: Jesse Daniel Brown, 2026-07-21.

Two regimes, because the honest answer is different in each:
  A) GENERATED structure (data that LIES ON the shared sphere): the rime address
     is a fraction of a rime; bits-per-element -> ~0. This is the ADDRESSING axis.
  B) ARBITRARY data (real enwik bytes, off the structure): to reconstruct the exact
     sequence you must store its rime coordinate per symbol = the data's ENTROPY.
     The rime relabel is rate 1.0 (adds NOTHING) — the GATE. Not sub-entropy.
