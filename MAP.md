# Asolaria — THE MAP (how these repos connect)

One system, split across repos. This map is identical in every repo — find this repo by name in the
tables below to see where you are; follow the links to walk the rest.

## READ-FIRST index — bootstrap → status → canon → maps → sessions
_pattern: external-peer proposed (AETHER doc-hierarchy), adopted 2026-07-01_
1. **Bootstrap** — `README.md` (what this repo is; the binding extract-don't-judge discipline + tags)
2. **Status** — README "Current state" + `SOTA-BENCH-AND-QUANT-FINDINGS-2026-06-23.md`
3. **Canon** — `canon/PRISM-COMB-0LOSS-LAW.md` — the **current-frame unifying law** over catalog
   classes A–K: every cataloged prism/comb op is a bijection (`H(f(X)) = H(X)`); 0-loss re-relation,
   never sub-entropy compression
4. **Maps** — this file (`MAP.md`, the repo web) + `CHAIN.md` (spine navigation)
5. **Sessions** — `acer/` + `liris/` seat catalogs + `BILATERAL-COMPARE.md` (bilateral reconcile)

## The spine — mechanism → running fleet (read backwards, newest → fleet)
```
 [5] collision discipline ─► [4] algorithm ─► [3] reduction ─► [2] emitter ─► [1] router ─► [0] FLEET

## Prism/Comb 0-loss (2026-07-01) — satellite law entry
One theorem over catalog classes A–K: every prism/comb operation is a **bijection** — forward =
comb (collision-avoidance, spine [5]), backward = prism (the many→1 reduction each replicated
service terminates in, spine [3]/[4]). Entropy is bijection-invariant, so re-relation is 0-loss
and no catalog entry claims sub-Shannon compression. Full adapted math:
`canon/PRISM-COMB-0LOSS-LAW.md`. Scope: 256↔1024 rung MEASURED (Q-PRISM `53023b6`); 43+ ladder
CANON frame; unproven rungs UNVERIFIED. E=0 — docs only, nothing fired.

## Current state & evolution (2026-06-28) — read this, don't flatten it
Asolaria is a **2.5-month archaeology**, not a flat stack. **Capability lineage:** auto-approval switch →
dashboard → multi-agent → local+web MCP + code-wiki → index language (pixels-first) → cubes-as-catalogs
in expanding Brown-Hilbert space → map-map-mapped → cube-cube-cubed → 256-symbol language → 1024-symbol
language → (asked 2048 — chose instead) **HBI/HBP + binary/hex/hash/sha/crypto-as-tokens** → **8-byte host
process** (replaces the ancient Node processes, for speed). The fabric's own 27-strata record is the
`archaeology_timeline` (birth 2026-02-22 → FABRIC EPOCH → genome).

The system **now** is **multiple of everything**: **16 levels (L0-L15) · multiple MCP engines (17) ·
multiple emitters · multiple languages** (index / pixels-first / BEHCS-256 / BEHCS-1024 / HBI-HBP).
**Current frame = 60D HyperBEHCS / BEHCS-1024**; 35D / 47D / 49D + BEHCS-256 are **bridge strata** below
it (old decodes new). The **kernel** is `asolaria-federation-1024` (the Rust 8-byte host). The current
effort is **"map while upgrading"** — and **this repo web is that map**.

## How it all fits
The **emitter [2]** produces 200ns PID signals on the local sequential emission clock; the **router [1]** delivers them; the **fleet [0]**
materialises spindles. Each spindle obeys the **reduction principle [3]** / **algorithm [4]** and the
**collision discipline [5]**. After every trigger, the spindle's answer runs the **post-trigger pipeline**
(`Shannon-and-the-gnns-stage`), scored by the **trained GNNs/FNNs** (`Asolaria-fnns-trained-…`), and the
**white rooms** (liris LEG-1) keep the genius / compact the mistakes — the PRISM many→1 reduction, seen
from the result side. The **back end** (`Asolaria-the-after-100-billion-run-…`) then absorbs the gulped
data, decomposes + mints the cubes, and — operator-gated — promotes the geniuses into supervisors/PIDs.
All gated / E=0 / describe-only — no fire, no cutover without operator authority.
